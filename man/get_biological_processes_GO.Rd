\title{Get GO Biological Processes}
\usage{
get_biological_processes_GO(
  input_file = "gene_attribute_edges.txt",
  output_file = "biological_processes.RData"
)
}
\description{
Reads a gene-to-GO mapping file and constructs a table of biological
processes with their associated gene sets.
}
\details{
The input file `gene_attribute_edges.txt` must contain at least the
following columns:
- `GO.Biological.Process`: Biological process name
- `Gene.ID`: Entrez gene ID or equivalent identifier

The function aggregates all genes per process, counts them, and
outputs a `data.frame` with:
- `Total`: Number of genes in the process
- `Process`: Process name
- `Entrez_ID`: Comma-separated list of genes
- Extra columns: Each gene in a separate column (wide format)

Finally, the result is saved as `biological_processes.RData`.
