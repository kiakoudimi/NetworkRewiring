# NetworkRewiring

R package for quantiying pathway perturbations in gene co-expression networks. 

## Features

- Preprocessing gene co-expression data.
- Compute gene co-expression networks defined as pathway specific biological processes obtained from KEGG and GO databases.
- Compute network rewiring scores and generate pathway specific summary statistics (indicating pathway perturbations).
